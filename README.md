# Research & Development Project---VANET

Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) have attracted a lot of research recent years. Although
VANETs are deployed in reality offering several services, the current architecture has been facing many
difficulties in deployment and management because of poor connectivity, less scalability, less flexibility
and less intelligence. 

Inegration of new emerging technologies such as software-defined Networking and fog
computing have solved many challenges faced in VANET architecture. SDN-based architecture provides
flexibility, scalability, programmability and global knowledge while Fog Computing offers delay-
sensitive and location-awareness services which could satisfy the demands of future VANETs
scenario. 

Due to increase in the demand of the cloud services, there has been an increase in consumption
of energy in order to satisfy these demands. Hence energy optimization has become an emergent issue.
Since the SDN relies on centralized network management, it adds to administratorsâ€™ worries regarding
server (controller) security. If by any means server gets hacked, then whole network becomes more
prone to be attacked. Hence security is another major challenge in VANET architecture. 

By keeping the above challenges in mind, we proposed an energy-efficient network management strategy which
reduces the consumption of energy while satisfying the demand of the cloud services and we
implemented various security measures such as ARP spoofing, DDOS attack mitigation and hybrid
cryptography in SDN architecture. Several simulation experiments were conducted using tools such as
Floodlight and Mininet in order to evaluation the results. Various simulation-based results prove the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model.
